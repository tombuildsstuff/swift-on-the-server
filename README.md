Hello.

This Repository contains resources and projects used in the Swift on the Server talk given at Build Stuff.

Each branch corresponds to a section of the talk:
 1 - Hello World
 2 - Returning JSON
 3 - Parsing out of / Inserting into MySql

To run this - you'll want a MySql server with the following schema:
```
CREATE TABLE towns
(
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

This repository is simply extending the default Vapor Web Application Template generated by:
```
vapor new <project>
```

You can build this via:
```
vapor build
```

And run it via:
```
vapor run
```
